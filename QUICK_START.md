# 🎯 Quick Start Guide - Personal Library Management System

## 📍 Current Status
✅ **ALL ISSUES FIXED** - Project is production ready!

## 🚀 Start Project in 2 Ways

### Way 1️⃣: Using Docker (RECOMMENDED - Easiest)
```bash
cd c:\Users\hp\Desktop\5th\ sem\ academic\DevOps_Project
docker compose up --build

# Wait for all services to start...
# Then open browser:
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend API: http://localhost:4000
```

**Time needed**: ~2-3 minutes

---

### Way 2️⃣: Manual Setup (For Development)

#### Step 1: Start MySQL
```bash
docker run --name library-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword -e MYSQL_DATABASE=librarydb -e MYSQL_USER=libraryuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=librarypass -p 3306:3306 -d mysql:8.0
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Database
```bash
mysql -h localhost -u root -prootpassword librarydb < db-init.sql
```

#### Step 3: Start Backend
```bash
cd Backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
# Runs on http://localhost:4000
```

#### Step 4: Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend/frontend
npm install
npm start
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Time needed**: ~5-10 minutes
